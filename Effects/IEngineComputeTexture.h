// IEngineComputeTexture -- the third output lane of a compute-analysis effect.
//
// A compute analysis node can publish its Result[] in three shapes, and which
// ones it materialises depends on who is actually consuming it:
//
//   1. StructuredBuffer SRV  (IEngineComputeOutput::GetAnalysisSrv)
//        For a COMPUTE consumer. Bound straight to a t-slot; the cheapest
//        lane, and the one the Phase 8 GPU bindings already use.
//   2. CPU values            (EffectNode::analysisOutput.fields)
//        For anything CPU-side: a Numeric Expression, the properties panel,
//        an MCP read. Costs a Map() that waits on the GPU -- measured at
//        ~10 ms of stall per frame at 5 Mpx, because it destroys CPU/GPU
//        overlap rather than merely copying nine floats.
//   3. A 1-row RGBA32F TEXTURE  (this interface)
//        For a PIXEL-shader consumer. Direct2D will not let a custom pixel
//        shader bind an arbitrary SRV -- it maps a transform's INPUTS to
//        Texture2D at t0, t1, ... and nothing else -- and the obvious way
//        round, ID2D1EffectContext::CreateResourceTexture, takes `const
//        BYTE*` CPU memory, so it would reintroduce exactly the readback
//        lane 3 exists to avoid. Publishing the values as a tiny image and
//        wiring it in as an ordinary effect input keeps them GPU-resident.
//
// Lane 3 is OPT-IN: the texture and its copy pass are not created until a
// consumer calls RequestAnalysisTexture(). A graph with no pixel-shader
// consumer never pays for it.
//
// Layout: texel i of row 0 holds Result[i], so field lookup is the same
// prefix-sum over `analysisFields` that lane 1 uses. As with
// IEngineComputeOutput, the field->index mapping is deliberately NOT part of
// this interface: it lives on EffectNode::analysisOutput.fields, and the
// evaluator has the node in hand.
