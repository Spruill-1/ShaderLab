# D2D / D3D11 Hybrid Compute System

## Problem

D2D's custom compute shader API (`ID2D1ComputeTransform`) has fundamental limitations that prevent full-image reduction operations:

| Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Per-tile UAV clearing** | D2D clears the output `RWTexture2D<float4>` before each tile dispatch. Scatter writes don't accumulate across tiles. |
| **No custom UAV binding** | `ID2D1ComputeInfo::SetResourceTexture` binds read-only `ID2D1ResourceTexture` (register t), not UAVs (register u). |
| **No uint atomics on output** | The output UAV is `RWTexture2D<float4>`. `InterlockedMin`/`InterlockedMax`/`InterlockedAdd` require `RWBuffer<uint>`. |
| **No input as D3D11 texture** | `PrepareForRender` doesn't expose the input image as a D3D11 surface. The effect context is deliberately isolated from the device. |

The built-in `CLSID_D2D1Histogram` effect works around these via private D2D internals not exposed through the public API.

## Solution: Evaluator-Owned D3D11 Dispatch

The graph evaluator owns a **raw D3D11 compute dispatch path** that bypasses D2D's tiling entirely. D2D handles the effect graph wiring (input/output connections), while D3D11 handles the actual computation.

## Three Effect Types Compared

| | D2D Pixel Shader | D2D Compute Shader | D3D11 Hybrid Compute |
|---|---|---|---|
| **COM class** | `CustomPixelShaderEffect` | `CustomComputeShaderEffect` (D2D-tiled mode) | `CustomComputeShaderEffect` (D3D11 mode) |
| **D2D interface** | `ID2D1DrawTransform` | `ID2D1ComputeTransform` | `ID2D1DrawTransform` (pass-through) |
| **Shader target** | `ps_5_0` | `cs_5_0` | `cs_5_0` (dispatched by host) |
| **Execution** | D2D renders directly | D2D dispatches per-tile | Evaluator dispatches via D3D11 |
| **Tiling** | D2D-managed | D2D-managed (UAV cleared) | **None** — single dispatch |
| **Atomics** | N/A | No (float4 UAV only) | **Yes** (RWStructuredBuffer / RWBuffer) |
| **groupshared** | N/A | Yes (per-tile only) | **Yes** (full image) |
| **Shader linking** | Yes (D2D optimizes) | No | No |
| **Image output** | Yes | Yes | Optional (pass-through or none) |
| **Analysis output** | Via pixel readback | Via pixel readback | Via `RWStructuredBuffer<float4> Result` |
| **`CustomShaderType`** | `PixelShader` | `ComputeShader` | `D3D11ComputeShader` |

The `D3D11ComputeShader` mode is what powers Channel / Luminance / Chromaticity Statistics, the gamut analysis effects, and any user-authored "analyze the whole image" shader created via the Effect Designer. Internally it dispatches through `Rendering::D3D11ComputeRunner`.

## Result lanes

A D3D11 compute node's `Result[]` reaches its consumers by one of three routes, which the code calls lanes:

- **Lane 1** -- the result structured buffer's SRV (`IEngineComputeOutput::GetAnalysisSrv`), bound into a D3D11 compute consumer's `SHADERLAB_GPU_BUFFER` slot. No CPU round-trip.
- **Lane 2** -- the CPU readback (`D3D11ComputeRunner`'s staging ring, blocking or async). Fills `analysisOutput.fields`, which the Properties panel, MCP and CPU-side bindings read.
- **Lane 3** -- `Result[]` copied into a 1 x N RGBA32F texture (`IEngineComputeTexture`), the only GPU route a Direct2D *pixel* shader can consume. Created only after a consumer calls `RequestAnalysisTexture()`.

`Rendering::PlanGpuBindings` decides which lane serves each binding (decision #141).

## Usage: ShaderLab Evaluator (Optimized Path)

```cpp
// The shape of ProcessDeferredCompute's input pre-render (Rendering/Evaluator/ComputeScheduler.cpp):

// 1. Render upstream D2D output to FP32 bitmap
winrt::com_ptr<ID2D1Bitmap1> gpuTarget;
dc->CreateBitmap(D2D1::SizeU(w, h), nullptr, 0, fp32Props, gpuTarget.put());
winrt::com_ptr<ID2D1Image> prevTarget;
dc->GetTarget(prevTarget.put());
dc->SetTarget(gpuTarget.get());
dc->Clear(D2D1::ColorF(0, 0, 0, 0));
dc->DrawImage(upstreamNode->cachedOutput);
dc->SetTarget(prevTarget.get());

// 2. Flush D2D command batch — CRITICAL for D2D→D3D11 handoff.
//    D2D batches DrawImage commands until EndDraw() or Flush().
//    Without this, D3D11 reads uninitialized zeros from the texture.
dc->Flush();

// 3. Get D3D11 texture (zero-copy — same DXGI surface)
winrt::com_ptr<IDXGISurface> surface;
gpuTarget->GetSurface(surface.put());
winrt::com_ptr<ID3D11Texture2D> d3dTexture;
surface->QueryInterface(d3dTexture.put());

// 4. Dispatch the node's compute shader on the texture (single call)
auto values = runner.DispatchWithImageOutput({ d3dTexture.get() }, cbuffer, resultCount,
                                             imageOutput, groupsX, groupsY, 1);

// 5. Unpack Result[] into the node's analysis fields (lane 2)
UnpackAnalysisFloats(*node, values);
```

## Known Limitations

- **D2D→D3D11 flush required**: When rendering a D2D effect chain to a bitmap and then reading it with D3D11, `dc->Flush()` **must** be called between `DrawImage` and any D3D11 access to the underlying texture. D2D batches draw commands until `EndDraw()` or `Flush()` — without an explicit flush, D3D11 reads zeros from the texture. Applied in the evaluator's shared pre-render (`PreRenderInput`, `Rendering/Evaluator/ComputeScheduler.cpp`) and the bridge's `PrepareInputTexture`.
- **The draw-session contract is SPLIT, and both halves matter.** `ProcessDeferredCompute` must run **inside** an active `BeginDraw`/`EndDraw` session, because it pre-renders each compute input with `dc->DrawImage` into an FP32 bitmap; outside a session that `DrawImage` silently no-ops and the compute reads a black input. But `GraphEvaluator::Evaluate` must run **outside** one: the D2D Histogram and custom-analysis readbacks open their *own* `BeginDraw`, and nesting that fails with `D2DERR_WRONG_STATE` (`0x88990001`). (Until 2026-09-25 `Evaluate` also pre-rendered compute inputs that way, via the now-deleted `PreRenderInputBitmap`; see below.) Any post-dispatch `Evaluate` sweep that must happen inside the session is `Evaluate(graph, dc, EvalMode::Frozen)`: it cannot queue a compute node, opens no readback session (the Histogram defers its read to the next frame), and leaves variant and async-readback polling to the next normal pass. `Rendering::FrameExecutor::Run` owns this order and every host calls it (decision #133); hosts no longer write the sequence themselves.
- **Compute inputs are pre-rendered in exactly one place: inside `ProcessDeferredCompute`, after any producer in the same pass has been dispatched.** That makes them fresh by construction across `compute -> compute` and `compute -> pixel shader -> compute` chains. There used to be a second, `Evaluate`-time snapshot "taken while properties are fresh"; it predated the producer's dispatch, so it had to be discarded for exactly the inputs where freshness matters, and it allocated a new full-size FP32 bitmap (133 MB at 4K) per input per dirty frame. Targets now persist, keyed by producing node + output pin (decision #95), and an input the shader can read in place is bound without a copy: a premultiplied FP16 or FP32 bitmap covering exactly its bounds from the origin, whose surface is a whole single-sample shader-readable texture of that size (`Rendering::ComputeReadableTexture`). That covers image, capture and video sources and another compute node's output; only an effect chain, an offset image or another format is drawn into the FP32 copy (decision #209). Inputs are resolved from the graph at dispatch time; the image recorded in the queue is only a fallback. Unbounded inputs (Flood, Tile, Border, Turbulence) are refused with a runtime error, and fractional bounds are snapped outward to whole pixels (`Effects::SnapComputeInputRect`).
- **Deferred compute runs in topological order, and the Direct2D nodes between dispatches are re-evaluated before they are read** (decision #127). The queue is filled across the host's `Evaluate` passes, so it is sorted by `GraphModel::TopologicalSort` before dispatching. A dispatch changes its node's pixels and analysis values, but a Direct2D node downstream of it (a `CIE Chromaticity Plot` reading a `CIE Histogram`, a tone mapper whose `SourcePeakNits` is bound to a statistics node) was wired, sized and bound by `Evaluate` before the dispatch ran -- on the first frame it is not wired at all, since its producer had no output yet. So before dispatching a consumer, `ProcessDeferredCompute` walks the consumer's Direct2D inputs (stopping at compute nodes) and, if any is dirty and a dispatch has run since the last refresh, re-runs `Evaluate` frozen: nothing is queued and no readback opens a draw session. Without it a `Side by Side` fed by `histogram -> plot` failed with `0x8007139F` on the first frame (the plot had empty bounds) and stayed failed on a paused graph. A compute node is queued even when its input 0 has no image yet, as long as that input's producer is queued in the same cycle; the image is resolved after the producer dispatches.
- **A wired input that is not ready fails the dispatch by name, and a failed dispatch leaves no output.** An input with no image or empty bounds (an upstream shader still compiling, a failed producer) sets `Input N has no image yet; its upstream is not ready` instead of dispatching into a variadic node whose `InputMask` and derived size would disagree. Any failed dispatch clears the node's `cachedOutput` and dirties its downstream, so the preview and *Save image* show nothing rather than the last good frame, which read as current. A successful dispatch clears the node's `dirty`; a frozen `Evaluate` leaves a dirty compute node dirty (it cannot queue it), so a change found after the dispatch -- a binding value read back late, an input re-dirtied -- is dispatched on the next frame instead of being dropped.
- **Size limits.** A compute input is copied into one D3D11 texture, so it can be at most 16384 px on a side (`D3D11_REQ_TEXTURE2D_U_OR_V_DIMENSION`); a larger one is refused with a runtime error naming the limit, never truncated. When an input has to be copied, the copy is FP32, 16 bytes per pixel: 265 MB for a 7680x2160 desktop, 398 MB at 11520x2160, per compute input; a source read in place costs nothing extra. Custom **pixel shaders** have no size limit of their own -- Direct2D tiles them -- and their output rect is the union of their image inputs. Only an edge that no input bounds (Flood, Tile, Border, Turbulence) is pinned: left/top to 0, right/bottom to the widest bounded input or 4096, because `TEXCOORD` is normalised over that rect and an infinite one sends every pixel to the same texel (decision #116).
- **A bridge dispatch names the step it failed at** (decision #170). `CustomComputeBridgeEffect::Dispatch` checks its arguments, installs its shader, copies its inputs, creates its output texture and dispatches, in that order, and `LastFailureStage` says which step failed; the node reads e.g. `Bridge dispatch failed creating the compute shader (0x80070057)`. The shader goes first because it is cheap: bytecode `CreateComputeShader` refused is remembered and fails at once on later frames, instead of costing a full copy of every input each time. The runner grows its parameter cbuffer past its 256 bytes when the user constants need it (they used to be truncated at 248), fails the dispatch on a failed constant `Map`, and reports a failed blocking readback `Map` as stale analysis fields on the node while the dispatch itself stands (decision #171).
- **A compute node is queued at most once per evaluate cycle.** The frame's `ComputeQueue::queued` set lives until `ProcessDeferredCompute` drains the queue, so a second `Evaluate` pass would otherwise re-queue a binding consumer of a node queued in the first -- two dispatches of the same node. The dispatch reads the node's state when it runs, so one entry is always current.
- **`ShaderVariants` owns what a variant is** (decision #142). `MakeVariantRequest` builds every cache request (the evaluator's baseline, option variants and GPU-binding shapes, and the user-effect library's validation compile), `BuildVariantMacros` spells `_SLPARAM_<name>_GPU`, `_SLOPT_<name>_MODE` and `_SLOPT_<name>`, and `PrecompileBindingShapes` warms the per-parameter shapes under the same keys the evaluator asks for. `BytecodeCache` only stores and compiles requests.
- **Shader variants are identified by DXBC checksum.** The bridge treats `SetCompiledBytecode` with the installed checksum as a no-op and keeps a few created shaders per node; the evaluator memoizes variant bytecode and cbuffer reflection by checksum (decision #96). The evaluator installs whatever the binding plan implies before every dispatch -- there is no restore-to-baseline afterwards.
- **A compute node re-dispatches on a PULLED dirty flag, and the pull includes property bindings.** `needsCompute` has no "my input image changed" term of its own -- it reads `node->dirty`, which `Evaluate` sets at the node's visit by asking whether anything it reads changed earlier in the same pass (`m_outputChangedThisEval`). Two reasons this is a pull and not the push pass it used to be. A **property binding is an invalidation edge but not a graph edge**: a `Clock` has no output pins and no edges, so a push along edges never reaches what it animates. And a node **becomes dirty mid-pass**, when `ResolveBindings` sees a bound value move -- invisible to a pass that already ran, and cleared before the next one, so the change propagated on no frame at all. The symptom was silent and convincing: an analysis node downstream of animated content dispatched on the single frame its `analysisOutput.fields` was still empty, then reported those fields forever while its input kept moving. If you add a new site that sets `node->dirty` during the main loop, mark the node with `MarkOutputChanged` there too, or its consumers will not learn. One exception is deliberate: a video Source whose bound `Time` moved goes into `m_fieldsChangedThisEval` instead, which wakes nodes bound to its analysis fields but not the nodes reading its image; its image changes only on an upload, which dirties it directly (see [animation-system.md](../ui-ux/animation-system.md#video-playback)).
- **Readback is blocking, asynchronous or skipped per dispatch, by the evaluator's own options.** Each `GraphEvaluator` renders with a `Rendering::EvaluatorOptions` (GPU bindings, readback skip, async readback, hint throttle, output caching, sub-rect demand, command-list submission): pinned with `SetOptions`, otherwise the process defaults in `Performance::`, copied once per frame (decision #136). `D3D11ComputeRunner` has a 3-slot staging ring. Blocking (`Map` straight after submit) drains the whole GPU pipeline and is what headless, the tests and MCP-forced reads get. With `asyncAnalysisReadback` -- the GUI only -- and `skipUnneededCpuReadback` on, a needed readback is queued instead; `Evaluate` polls it with `DO_NOT_WAIT` at the start of each pass, unpacks it, and dirties everything bound to the node. `HasPendingReadbacks()` tells the host to keep rendering until it lands (decision #97). A readback is skipped only for a node whose every bound consumer reads the value on the GPU in the variant it actually ran last; a consumer on its generic fallback while a variant compiles reads the cbuffer and keeps the readback on (decision #114).
- **The analysis readback happens inside the DISPATCH, so forcing a frame is not enough to refresh it.** `isReadbackNeeded` gates the GPU->CPU copy, and the host's CPU-analysis interest set holds only the **GUI-selected node** and its binding sources -- so over MCP, where nothing is selected, no dispatch carries `readback=true`. A forced frame still copies nothing if the node happens to be clean that frame. `GET /analysis/{id}` therefore dirties the node and calls `GraphEvaluator::RequestFreshCpuReadback(id)`, which makes that node's next dispatch read back, blocking, whatever the skip, throttle and async options say; the request is spent by that dispatch. It no longer flips a process-wide flag around the frame (decision #137). Any other route that means to report fresh analysis values must do the same.
- **Lane 3 is requested whenever the binding plan can serve a pixel shader from it, not only when readbacks are skipped** (decision #138). A producer publishes its 1-row analysis texture only once asked, and has to be asked before the dispatch that fills it. The request used to sit inside the skip-readback branch, so headless and the tests -- which read back every dispatch -- never engaged the texture lane and ran a different binding path from the GUI. Now `skipUnneededCpuReadback` gates only the CPU `Map`; `GraphEvaluator::AppliedGpuBits` reports the build a consumer ran (test `Lane3_AppliedTextureModeWithoutReadbackSkip`).
- **Compute never issues a multi-call sequence on the shared immediate context** (except in the benchmark-only `EvaluatorOptions::computeCommandList = false` mode, which the runner takes per dispatch as `UseImmediateContextForBenchmark`). That context also carries Direct2D's work (both D2D contexts share the device), and `SetMultithreadProtected` makes single calls safe, not sequences — a dispatch issued call by call could run with its bindings clobbered by another thread and write nothing while returning `S_OK`. `D3D11ComputeRunner` records everything on its own deferred context and submits once via `ExecuteCommandList(list, TRUE)`; the immediate context sees only that call and the readback `Map`. `TRUE` preserves the immediate context's state for whoever else is mid-sequence on it. Anything new that issues D3D11 commands on this device should follow the same pattern rather than take `ID2D1Multithread`, which would tie it to Direct2D.
- **Generator compute nodes** (no image inputs — e.g. `ICtCp Gamut Boundary LUT`) are fed a 1×1 zero placeholder as input 0, because the dispatch gate, the deferred queue and the bridge's pre-render all assume one. The placeholder is never dirty, so a generator re-dispatches only when its own properties move. Size its output with hidden `OutputWidth`/`OutputHeight` defaults — the explicit-size path.
- **Image-output size, in order:** a built-in's `deriveImageOutputSize` hook (given each wired input's pre-rendered size, `{0, 0}` for an unwired pin), then explicit `OutputWidth` + `OutputHeight`, then the declared `outputExtent` (a square size, at least 64), then input 0's size. An output past 16384 px on a side is refused with a runtime error before the dispatch, as an over-size input is. `Side by Side` uses the hook: at Native its output is the tile arrangement, which depends on how many inputs are wired and how big the first one is (decision #118).
- **Variadic compute nodes** work as variadic pixel shaders do: every unwired pin holds the 1×1 zero placeholder and the evaluator writes `InputMask` (bit i = pin i wired) before each dispatch. Each input arrives at its own native size, so `GetDimensions` on its texture is exact -- unlike a D2D pixel shader input, which may sit in a larger atlas allocation.
- **One unpacker owns the analysis-field layout.** Fields sit one after another in a row of float4 pixels, `AnalysisFieldPixelCount` each: a scalar or vector takes one pixel, a `FloatArray` packs four elements per pixel, and the other arrays take one pixel per element. `Graph::UnpackAnalysisFields` decodes that layout for both readback paths (the bridge's D3D11 readback and the Direct2D analysis readback); the bridge path used to read a `FloatArray` one element per pixel, which scrambled the array and read into the fields after it (test `FieldLayout_*`).
- **One binding plan decides every GPU-binding question** (decision #141). `Rendering::PlanGpuBindings` (`Rendering/GpuBindingPlan.h`) lists, per consumer, the bindings its lane serves -- parameter, gpu-bindable index, mode, producer and float4 index -- plus the packed variant bits. The lane-1 SRV routing in `DispatchViaBridge`, the lane-3 texture pins in `ApplyCustomEffect`, the option-variant precompile shape and the readback pre-pass all read it, so they cannot disagree; they differ only in the `producerReady` test they pass (an SRV exists, a bitmap exists, the bridge exists, or nothing for the eventual shape). A binding qualifies when GPU bindings are on, its parameter is gpu-bindable, its producer is a D3D11 compute node (a Clock or Float Parameter publishes nothing on the GPU) and the lane can address it. Both lanes serve a multi-component binding whose components are consecutive components of one element (`float2` from `Vec.xy`); lane 3 used to require a single source. The readback skip asks whether the consumer's last build (`AppliedGpuBits`) read the binding on the GPU, and a skipped-but-not-served binding requests readback from every source it reads, whole-array bindings included.
- **A GPU binding lane serves a binding only when it can address exactly the value the CPU path reads.** A lane loads one float4 and swizzles it by the parameter type (`.x`, `.xy`, ...), so destination component *i* must be component *i* of one element of the source field: a binding to `Mean.y` from a `float` parameter, or a `FloatArray` element outside a pixel's `.x`, stays on the cbuffer path, and so does the readback it needs. Before, the lanes ignored `sourceComponent` and served `.x` (test `ComponentBinding_*`).
- **No shader linking**: D3D11 compute shaders are opaque to D2D. They don't participate in D2D's shader linking optimization for chained pixel shader effects.
- **The dispatch shape is declared** (`CustomEffectDefinition::dispatchShape`; see [Node contracts](effect-graph-model.md#node-contracts)). `PerOutputPixel` is tiled by the evaluator over the output with the group size reflected from the bytecode's `[numthreads]`; `SingleGroup`, `ReduceGroups` and `ImagePass` dispatch `(1,1,1)` and the runner widens a reduction or image pass itself. It used to be inferred: a group of 256 threads or more, or a `DiagramSize`/`OutputSize` parameter, meant one group, and CIE Histogram (16×16 in its HLSL, 8×8 in its descriptor) depended on the parameter name alone.
- **Whole-image reductions are multi-group by opt-in.** A data-only node is dispatched `(1,1,1)` by default. A shader that writes `SHADERLAB_REDUCE_SCRATCH` (from `shaderlab_params.hlsli`) is instead dispatched `SHADERLAB_REDUCE_GROUPS` (64) groups wide, with a uint scratch buffer at `u2`: each group writes a partial block, then `ShaderLabReduceIsLastGroup(tid)` (an atomic counter in scratch word 0) elects the last group to finish, which folds the partials and writes `Result`. Only the first `SHADERLAB_REDUCE_CLEARED` words are zeroed per dispatch -- counter plus any `InterlockedAdd` accumulators -- so partials above that must be written in full by every group. The runner detects opt-in by reflecting `_SLScratch`, which keeps saved graphs carrying the old single-group HLSL dispatching as before (decision #98). All five built-in statistics / scatter effects use it. The macro adds one groupshared `uint` for the last-group flag; a shader whose own groupshared already fills the 32 KB `cs_5_0` limit writes `SHADERLAB_REDUCE_SCRATCH_SHARED_FLAG(flag)` instead, after declaring its arrays, naming a groupshared word it no longer needs at that point (Gamut Coverage passes its first bin, which it has already folded and reloads afterwards). That form adds a barrier after the flag is read so the shader cannot overwrite it early.
- **Scatter-to-image effects run as two dispatches by opt-in.** A shader whose image pixels are bins the input is scattered into (CIE Histogram) writes `SHADERLAB_IMAGE_PASS(type)` at file scope instead of `SHADERLAB_REDUCE_SCRATCH`. That declares a `_SLPassConstants` cbuffer at `b1` holding `ShaderLabPass`, the scratch buffer at `u2`, and `RWStructuredBuffer<type> _SLPixelAccum` at `u3`. The runner reflects the two names (and the structured buffer's stride, which reflection reports in `NumSamples`), allocates one `type` per image-output pixel, and records in one command list: clear the scratch head and the output image, dispatch pass 0 with one thread per input-0 pixel (`ceil(W / numthreads.x) x ceil(H / numthreads.y)`), then pass 1 with one thread per output pixel. The caller's dispatch size is ignored. D3D11 orders the two dispatches, so pass 1 sees every pass-0 atomic. The accumulator is zeroed only when it is created (size or stride changed) or a shader is installed; after that **pass 1 must zero whatever pass 0 accumulated into**, which costs only the touched bins instead of a full clear every frame. `ShaderLabPass` is a cbuffer value rather than a UAV word because `fxc` rejects a barrier under a branch on anything it cannot prove uniform (X3663). The accumulator is `pixels x stride` bytes -- 256 MB for a 4096-square CIE Histogram -- and a failure to create it, like any other failure inside the runner, surfaces as the node's runtime error through `D3D11ComputeRunner::LastDispatchResult` (decision #119).
